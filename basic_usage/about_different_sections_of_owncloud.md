# Introduction

When you first log into ownCloud, there are four sections of the page that you need to pay attention to. Each section is crucial to being able to navigate around the web site effectively.

## Center Section

The most important section is the center, which will show the view of the file system from where you are currently located.  If you click on the name of folder (delineated by a little blue icon that looks like an old-style filing folder), you will move into that folder and your view will change to see the contents of that folder.

If, on the other hand, you click on the folder icon you will select this folder. This allows you to perform  certain adminstrative functions like download the entire contents of that directory to your desktop, or delete the directory.

You can also sort the list of a folder's contents by Modified date, Size or Name by simply clicking on the field name. You can sort by the values of this field in reverse order (highest to lowest) by making the little triangle next to the name point so the widest side is up and the tip of the triangle is down; or in orde (lowest to highest) by making hte trinagle tip point up. You can change the position of the triangle by clicking on the field name.

When you are deep in a folder hierarchy, and you want to backtrack, you can do so by using the breadcrumb bar at the top of the center section. This breadcrumb bar shows your path through the folder hierarchy and allows you to backtrack specifically two folders ahead of the folder you are in. To backtrack any further you will need to backtrack one or two folders until you arrive at the one you want. Or, if you just want to go back to your home view, you can click on the icon that looks like a house: this will take you all the way to the beginning of the folder hierarchy.

You can also mark a file or folder as a favorite. This feature is available for files or folders that may exist deep inside a folder hierarchy that is inconvenient to traverse to normally. By starring or favoriting a file or folder you can locate a frequently sought file or folder in your Favorites menu. Once you have favorited a file or folder, you can easily un-favorite it any time by simply un-starring it. You can do this by hovering your mouse over the file or folder until the star icon appears on the left side of the icon. Then you should click on the star and watch it turn from gray to yellow. Now, when you move your cursor icon away from the file or folder the star icon should remain and be yellow.
