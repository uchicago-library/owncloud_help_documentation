You can create a new folder by clicking on the plus icon in the breadcrumb bar at the top of the center section.

**WARNING: Be sure that you have navigated to the folder that you want to put the new file into.**

When you click on this icon, a sub-menu will appear below the plus icon with the following options

- Upload
- Folder
- Text File

By clicking on the folder option, you can create a new folder. Similarly to the text file option, by clicking here you will cause a new input field to appear next to the fiolder option with the text "New folder" that will be highlighted. By starting to type you will replace the text "New folder" with whatever you type. Once you have entered the name you want to call this new folder, simply click on the Enter key and the new folder with the name you just entered will appear in the center section.
