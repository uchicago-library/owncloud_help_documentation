# Introduction

You can create a new file by clicking on the plus icon in the breadcrumb bar at the top of the center section.

**WARNING: Be sure that you have navigated to the folder that you want to put the new file into.**

When you click on this icon, a sub-menu will appear below the plus icon with the following options

- Upload
- Folder
- Text File

The upload option will let you start a file upload. By clickong on this, the normal dialog that appears on your desktop when you want to select a file to upload to awebsite will appear.

The text file option lets you create a new text file. It will open an input field with the words "New file.txt" inside it and "New file" highlighted. By starting to type you will immediately be naming a text file, so that when you hit enter from that input field a new text file icon with the name that you just typed will appear in the center section.

Which of these two options you select depends on what kind of new file you want to add to the folder. If you are adding a brand new plain text file that doesn't yet have any content in, you should select the text file option.

If, on the other hand, you are adding a file that is on your desktop or a samba server or some other place, you should select Upload.
