# Introduction

You can see the contents of the file system in ownCloud in the center section of the web page. This is the largest area of the page and will show the contents of whatever folder you are inside of at at given moment in time.

When you first log in, however, you are viewing your home folder. This is a view of your private folders (folders that are visible only to you and not to anybody else in the system) and any folders that have been shared with you by other users.

For Special Collections staff, this home view will show whatever folders or files you have created in your home folder plus a folder called "Special Collections Research Center Publishing Space".

In order to navigate into the Special Collections Resarch Center Publishing Space, you need to click on the name of that folder. Once you do, the contents will change in the center section and you will be seeing the contents of the folder called "Special Collections Research Center Publishing Space". If you want to travel further into any folder, you simply click on the name of the folder that you want to navigate to. You should keep doing this until you have arrived at the folder location that you want to be at.

If while navigating down into a folder hierarchy, you want to back-track, you can do so by using the breadcrumb bar at the top of the center section. This breadcrumb bar shows (from right to left)  the folder immediately above the current folder, then the folder above that folder, then an elipses representing the rest of directories beneath the current location, then a home icon which leads back to your home directory.
